# Configuration
For optimal performance of **Lacework FortiCNAPP Composite Alert Incident Response** solution pack, you can install and configure the connectors that help with the following:

* **AWS EC2** - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.. To configure and use the AWS EC2 connector, refer to [Configuring AWS EC2](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/aws-ec2)
    * **Permissions**: `ec2:StopInstances`, `ec2:StartInstances`, `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:CreateSnapshot`, `ec2:DescribeVolumes`   
    * IAM role example:
        ```json   
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
